 # NIS EDA

NIS EDA is a dashboard designed to allow initial exploration of results of a NIS-formatted MuSIASEM case study.

It is a Shiny application which can be deployed using Docker images built using one of the two supplied Dockerfiles (one is for continuation of the development, RStudio+Shiny, the other contains just Shiny).
